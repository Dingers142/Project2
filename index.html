changed at 3.6 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Notable job gains occurred in
food services and drinking places, social assistance, and financial activities. Within manufacturing,
employment in motor vehicles and parts decreased due to strike activity. Federal government
employment was down, reflecting a drop in the number of temporary jobs for the 2020 Census.This news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey measures labor
force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The establishment survey
measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For more information about the
