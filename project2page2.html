	<div class="box c"><h1>Summary:</h1><h2>With key gatherings of world leaders in 2012, notably the June Rio+20 
	Summit and the G20 leaders’ meeting in Mexico, the ITUC is concentrating its demands on combined action to 
	create jobs, and tackle poverty and climate change. Priority demands include regulation of banks and finance 
	to make them focus on growth in the real economy, fair taxation to provide vital revenue for governments, and 
	initiatives to support the poorest and most vulnerable. Building a global social protection floor to promote 
	inclusive growth and provide income security is a cornerstone of the ITUC’s programme to ensure social justice 
	and create economic demand.We welcome the UN’s support for a social protection floor, and it is time now for 
	governments to put it in place. Setting minimum national standards for income and access for all to health, 
	education and other vital services will lift people out of poverty and help stop the erosion of living standards 
	and turn around the growth in inequality. This must be coupled with genuine respect for workers’ rights to union 
	representation and collective bargaining, in order to turn around the enormous and growing levels of inequality 
	across the world,</h2></div>
