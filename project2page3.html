	<div class="box c"><h1>Summary<h1><h2>The Employment Report put out monthly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is one of the most-watched indicators of the state of the United States economy, headed by one statistic: the unemployment rate. Not only does the rate of employment – or unemployment – provide a snapshot of the American economy’s strength, but it also delivers a measure of overall satisfaction – or dissatisfaction – with the state of America, its government and its leaders.
Most recently, the unemployment rate fluctuated wildly, from a low of 4.7 percent in 2008 to a peak of 10.1 percent in 2009, after the U.S. housing bubble burst and Wall Street saw collapses unlike those seen since the Great Depression in the 1920s and 1930s.
The consequences of widespread and lingering unemployment are dire – not just for the nation’s overall economy, which loses a significant portion of consumer spending, one of its key drivers of growth, but also for the unemployed individuals, themselves. Long-term unemployment can often be financially, emotionally and psychologically destructive.
A job helps define a person’s place in society, and productive work has long been understood as one of the key elements necessary for a happy life. Persistent unemployment can lead to illness, marital strife, depression and even suicide.
Also, being able to pay one’s bills, provide for one’s family and contribute to society are essential factors in maintaining cultural well-being and communal identity. In addition to the steep decline in home values, America’s recent spate of foreclosures, with its concomitant erosion of robust neighborhoods, has been a direct result of widespread unemployment.</h2></div>
